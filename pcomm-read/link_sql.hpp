// comm_edges and mem_owner the other way, and it stays — the suite's goldens are
// written against it and it is the oracle these queries are verified against.
// But a join is what this work *is*, the UI queries through DuckDB anyway, and
// a query someone can read and run by hand is worth more here than a second set
// of accumulators nobody can inspect without a debugger.
//
// The one rule these queries follow, and it is the expensive lesson this project
// already paid for: **a wire id is only unique with its scope.** `qp_num` is
// allocated per HCA, so two ranks routinely draw the same one — keying an owner
// map on `qp_num` alone produced impossible self-edges and a 4-peer set for an
// 8-rank job (see the comment at CsvAgg in main.cpp). Every join below keys on
// the pair, `(lid, qp_num)`, never on the number alone.
